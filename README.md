# head-pose-estimation

Mini-Project during Summer 2020

Used a facial landmark detector to estimate orientation of head.
Takes live video feed and estimates Euler angles representing head orientation.

Motivation: Many applications or games based on physical motion sensing, e.g. Kinect, require the user to be a sufficient distance away from the sensor and in a sufficiently large room.  In tighter spaces, such as at a desk setting, head pose estimation offers a much more feasible method of human-computer interaction.

The results of this project can be extended to allow users to control application or games in a convenient and intuitive manner.
